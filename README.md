# Fitness Class Scheduling

## The Problem Statement
My friend owns a popular fitness center in a bustling metropolitan area. Every morning, he reviews the number of class registrations to decide how many instructors to schedule and which classes to offer during the day. From their analysis, too many scheduled classes with few attendees can lead to unnecessary lost expenses, while too few classes may turn away members. It's in short, a delicate balance to maintain.

Predicting the exact number of class attendees from the registrations is not clear and straightforward. Many members sign up but don't show up, and some attend without prior registration. The fitness center owner understands that there is a correlation between registrations and actual attendance, but the specifics of this relationship are unclear.

The fitness center owner is seeking an objective and software based solution that analyzes historical class registration and attendance data. This program should be able to understand the relationship between class registrations and actual attendance, using this insight to predict the number of attendees for each class based on current registrations. 

Can we develop such a program for them?
